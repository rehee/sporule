I was having issue in my virtual environment that my PIP does not have permission to install packages because all the virtual environment packages were installed in the global site-packages rather than the virtualenv's site-packages. I think the issue was caused by using sudo to install the virutal environemnt which changed the System Environment Variable.

After some research on Google, I have found a few solutions:

1. The System environment variable "PATH" was set in the environment variable, we need to remove that so it can be pointed correctly to the virtual environment. Solution is typing the below code in the terminal:

```bash
$PATH
```

  
2. You can see the System environment variable "PATH" was set to the local bin, such as:

```bash
PATH=/home/<yourusername>/bin:/home/<yourusername>/.local/bin:/home/<yourusername>/.pyenv/shims:~/.pyenv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

3. The solution will be remove the parts that include bin and /.local/bin from the environment, so type the below code in the terminal:  
Â 

```bash
PATH=/home/<yourusername>/.pyenv/shims:~/.pyenv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```
